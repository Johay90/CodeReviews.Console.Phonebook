WIP/TODO

- Talk about Email sending (Ie: Mocking, use Papercut, not currently a real smtp server)
	- Just mocking, for a proper email service we would need to auth intial user with a email
	- Most likely will be fairly complex, ie implementing OAth for different email services etc.
	- You will need to do install some mocking tool (such as Papercut)
